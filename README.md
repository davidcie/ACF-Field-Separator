# ACF Field Separator

Dead simple ACF Field that allows you to insert a heading in between fields.  An alternative to tabs when you want fields to display in the same view, but still require some visual separation.

Code forked from [tybruffy](https://github.com/tybruffy/) who created [the original plugin for ACFv4](https://github.com/tybruffy/ACF-Field-Separator).
