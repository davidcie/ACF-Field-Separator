Dead simple ACF Field that allows you to insert a heading in between fields.

== Description ==

Dead simple ACF Field that allows you to insert a heading in between fields. An alternative to tabs when you want fields to display in the same view, but still require some visual separation.

Code forked from [tybruffy](https://github.com/tybruffy/) who created [the original plugin for ACFv4](https://github.com/tybruffy/ACF-Field-Separator). Most credit goes to him, but was unable to add him as contributor since he does not seem to be in the Wordpress.org user directory.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/acf-field-separator` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. On the field group edit screen add a new field and select 'Separator' as the field type.
